# Bootstrap Boilerplate and Practice
This is a repo of how to set up a Bootstrap boilerplate following the Content Delivery Network.

## Technologies
The version of Bootstrap used in this project is 5.1.3, and you can follow this link [Bootstrap 5.1.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template) to get started. For this project, we will not be installing any source files and instead will be utilizing Bootstrap through a Content Delivery Network (CDN). To do this, copy and paste the following line into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets in your HTML:
```
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

## Note
This method of using Bootstrap requires access to the internet.
